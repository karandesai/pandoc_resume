** THIS MODULE IS FOR EXPERTS USERS ONLY !! **

This is an experimental module using the swiglib module for GraphicsMagick for conversion 
of (some) images in memory. 
You must have the binding for your system installed
(see http://swiglib.foundry.supelec.fr)
as well as the helpers module, and the luatex engine must support 
epdf.openMemStream which currently (2015.10.01) is still in the experimental branch.


The modules doesn't work with luajittex.

CAVEAT EMPTOR: interface is still in flux and can change radically
